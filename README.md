# Jeremy's website

## User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project.

[(Here is my milestone project](https://jeyasare.github.io/Move2Improve/))

My name is Jeremy and this is my website - Move2Improve. Move2Improve is fitness site aimed for anybody who is looking to start or enhance their fitness journey.
This project is for educational purposes only as it will only be used in my portfolio and wiil not be used for any business purposes.
The aim for this project is to build a fully responsive website for users on any devices such as phones, tablets and desktops.

# User Experience (UX)

## My goals for this website ?

My main intentions for this website is to build a functional and responsve frontend site with high end performance which maximises user experience. The features of this site helps users gain an understanding of what Move2Improve does and what we have to offer. For example, this site has features such as a Classes page where users can view various different types of exercises and workouts that would suit them. This site also has a Personal Trainers page for users who are loooking for a more intimte, more specific way of working out and would need one-to-one support.

## User goals

## New user goals:

- New users should be able to locate any information they need from the Move2Improve site.
- New users will also be able to see what the site has to offer through written and visual content,
- Finally if a new user wanted to get in touch or locate our business premises they will be able to get all contact information needed.

## Returning user goals:

- Returing users have up to 8 different classes they can choose to get involved in.
- Returning users have a selection of personal trainers available to them.
- Return users can easily get in touch if they have any quieries.

## Frequent user goals:

- Fequent user will be lookng to find out if there are any updates on our site
- Frequent users tend to be intrigued by some for of context, for example, newsletters or blogs.

## Design

## Colour Scheme

The main colours I used were:

- rgba(20, 69, 20, 0.23) - dark green
- rgba(100, 82, 179, 0.474) - lilac
- rgba(219, 176, 45, 0.474) - orange/gold
- rgba(21, 104, 42, 0.639) - lighter green
  The reason for using rgba was due to the vast range of colours that I could look at. Rgba is also very easy to use as you can also toggle with opacity.

## Typography

- The Anton font is the main and only font I used. This font stood out to me because of its boldness and thickness and for such a site as Move2Improve I wanted a stand out font that all users will be able to see with ease. I also fel that the font in some way fits in with Move2Improve as it is such a hard and robust font.

## Images/Pictures

- The imagery and setting I used for my pictures almost always revolved around people being in the gym, working out in the gym and having fun in the gym. Through the pictures you can see some individuals straining as they are squatting 100kg, but also see people having a relaxed session of yoga. I wanted the user to get the impression that Move2Improve is a well rounded gym that they can easily fit in with.

## Planning

- I planned on building my site using Balsamiq Wireframes. This site allowed me to plan the skeleton structure of my sight and invision how it would look like ince I have fully completed my website.

## Features

This site has 3 pages.

- Index.html: this page is my hompage. I have a hero-image at the start which catches users instantly and as they progress down the page they see brief descriptions about us for example, benefits of joining our finess regime and what our members already think of us. The page ends with a footer which entails our social media and contact information.
- Classes.html: this is my second page. This page shows all 8 classes we have to offer. Each picture has a name of the workout/exercise beside it so users know exactly what class they would like to do. Beneath that section is a review on 4 of our classes by our members. The page then ends with our footer.
- Personaltrainers.html: this is our third page. This page presents users of our 4 personal trainers. Each personal trainer has a self-portrait of themselves with quotes from their students. Below our personal trainers are more pictures of our gym and community which would be appealing on the eye for our users.

### What other features am I loooking to add?

- I would like to add a form section for users to fill out and get signed up to Move2Improve.
- I would also like to add videos to my site for a enhanced user experience.
  -Also I would like to offer a online course section for Move2Improve for users who would like to workout and exercise indoors.

## Technologies Used

The languages I used were:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Balsamiq
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome
- Github
- Codeanywhere
  I also used Midjourney which is a AI bot program where I type a request in and it delivers imagery. Thats what I used for all my images.

## Testing Used

I used markup validators to make sure that my code was all correct and that there were no errors in my code. It is a more efficient way to check for bugs when you have loads of code to check.

- validator.w3.org (Nu HTML checker)
- cssportal.com (css checker)
- When using the Html checker, my results showed that I had a few warning messages about my code. It told me that I had <sections> without any <h2>-<h6> which isn't the best way to write code. It also adviced me that instead of having a <section> element I should just use <div>.

## User stories testing

### Website owner

- I would like to offer users the ability to see Move2Improve and hopefully decide to join us.
  > For example on our personal trainers page, users have the ability to pick one or more personal trainers.
- I want my customers to easily navigate through my website.
  > Have an easy simple site for users to navigate through.
- I would like to build a community for Move2Improve.
  > On the footer the social media has been placed for people to find us online.

### First time user

- User may be looking for a upper nody workout group that he can join.
  > Move2Improve has a Classes section where it shows 8 different types of classesfor the user to pick some.
- User may have a question to ask directly to the stafff at Move2Improve.
  > We have our email and number and postal address listed on the footer of the page.

### Returning user

- User may want to share a class or personal trainer with their friend.
  > For our personal trainers, they have reviews from their students. That gives users more of an idea about what kind of personal trainer that they want.

## Deployment

To also be able to use Github repository you need to:

- Log into Github and click on repository
- Select settings and find Github pages at the bottom left.
- Go to the branch section and selct "main" and "roots" then click save
- Auto-refresh and your project shouold be live on Git Pages

### Further Testing

- Main testing platform was Google Chrome.
- I have tried using it on Safari. One issue I have gotten with Safari was that on my personal trainer page, my row of 8 pictures become 7 with the last picture underneath.
- I tested my website further on my iphone 14 pro max and also my iphone XR. I can easily navigate through the Move2Improve site with both phones.
- I have also sent my site to 2 family members who have iphone SE and iphone 7 and they were able to easily naviagte their way through the website. They both said that the website is user friendly and easy to use.

## Known Bugs

- As mentioned above when using Safari my row of 8 picture became 7 pictures whith 1 picture underneath.
- Other than that my site didn't have many consistent bugs.

- Log in to Github and click on repository to download
